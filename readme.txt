== Description ==

This plugin eleminates the negative impact chatbots have on your website's page speed. The way it does this is simple. It lazy loads the JavaScript required to load the chatbot widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes and no. This plugin prevents chatbots from negatively impacting your page speed, but it's not going to fix page speed issues outside of the chatbot.

In most cases, yes. If your website is loading a chatbot widget, it's likely negatively impacting your page speed. This plugin will prevent that.
